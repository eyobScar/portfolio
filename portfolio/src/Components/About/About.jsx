              Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio. I’m Eyob Alayu,
              a third-year Information Technology student at Bahir Dar University
              with a strong interest in full-stack web development. I’m currently
              seeking an internship opportunity where I can apply my skills, gain
              real-world experience, and continue growing as a developer.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Although I’m still early in my journey, I have many ideas and
              ambitions I’m eager to explore. I’m constantly learning,
              experimenting, and challenging myself to turn those ideas into real,
              meaningful projects. I enjoy building applications, exploring new
              technologies, and improving my skills every day through consistent
              practice.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I take real pleasure in solving problems, creating user-friendly
              experiences, and transforming concepts into working solutions. I
              hope my work reflects my dedication and passion for this field, and
              I look forward to opportunities where I can learn, contribute, and
              grow further.
            </p>
